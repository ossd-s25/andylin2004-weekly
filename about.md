### Hi there! I'm Andy Lin.
I'm a student at New York University (class of 2026) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Integrated Design and Media and an alumni of Stuyvesant High School (class of 2022). I also develop apps for Apple platforms (such as iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS), available on the Apple App Store. I typically program in Python and Swift, but, I also have experience programming in C, C#, C++, Java, Lua (including Roblox's Luau fork), and Rust. When I'm not busy doing coursework or developing my apps, I like to travel a lot.
