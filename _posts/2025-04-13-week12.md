title: Week 12

This week, I got to do a really insightful reading about what makes open source successful in the first place: the Bazaar model. I also got to see how open source has basically been embraced by corporations, though things do get tense over time (because, of course the goals of corporations will never really be aligned with open source projects).

### The Cathedral and the Bazaar

*The Cathedral and the Bazaar* follows through on an open source developer who ultimately ends up taking open source project as a result of trying to find a software that supported the email protocol he wanted to use and a specific functionality in the email protocol and learning a lot of valuable lessons about how his specific open source project operated. He wasn't able to find any, so he started forked two open source projects to extend the functionality of the software to support the specific functionality that he wanted to have in the software. 

(Note that I mentioned two: the writer discusses how he wished to contribute to a software that supported multiple email protocols, something the first forked open source project didn't support, so he had to fork another open source email client.)

But long story short, after the author contributed to the second open source email client, he was told by the former maintainer of that client that the former maintainer had lost interest in maintaining the project, and that it would be better for the project health if the writer took over maintaining the project, and he learned that what made his open source project great was the people who also supported the goals of his open source project, and the (sometimes conflicting but better) ideas that came along with them.

There were a few things that I could relate to the story, especially this one:

> "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow." (Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, Chapter 11)

Why would I relate to this? This is kind of twofold. Our professor, Johanna, did discuss how there have been teams in the past who had worked on creating a pull request to an issue, only to have it be kind of thrown out for whatever reason. And Stella and I have been attacking our open source project, OpenFoodFact's new mobile app, in this way too. At first, we actually claimed the issues that we wanted to fix (as in we would request to work on the issue, and then wait to get assigned). But later on, we just started taking on issues after we requested to work on the issue, since the maintainers sometimes took a bit to respond to our requests. We did these fixes under the expectation that maybe they already have a fix (which good on them, but it's good Dart and Flutter practice, which we also wanted to do since neither of us had that much experience in those fields). 

Namely, we claimed an issue where iOS users weren't able to switch between different text fields like on Android. We proposed just having a Flutter based solution of implementing this, since I have a philosophy of not waiting on the underlying framework to implement it and just implement it in any way that we could. However, this one guy didn't like our idea, as they would rather keep the code as the same as possible across all the platforms and would rather wait on the Flutter framework to implement the feature. We only found out about this after I had started searching up solutions to this problem, which was a bummer since we wanted to get another patch out (but instead, we get to talk about the different personalities of the project) and we had to throw all our efforts away. Oh well.
