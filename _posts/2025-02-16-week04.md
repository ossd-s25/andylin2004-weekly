title: Week 4

This week was a bit of everything. A bit of a Git command line lesson (but more of a refresher for me), and a lot of classmates showing off how good their JavaScript (and CSS surprisingly) skills are. It's kinda weird to see how good my classmates' presentation skills are (and they were probably better than mine)!

It was kind of interesting to just see how Git would be taught in the classroom, as I never really had a formal introduction to Git back in high school (when I was first introduced to Git and GitHub as a way of submitting assignments for my AP Computer Science class). I was mainly taught on how to clone a remote repo into my local machine, how to add files to the staging phase, how to write a commit message (like *any* Git message, and not a specially formatted one), and how to push things. Over time I kind of learned how to go out into new branches and how to jump between them, although these steps were kinda shaky since I didn't really have to use branches a lot, and how to untrack and remove files from a Git repository (since there are times when cache files accidentally get staged because I didn't pay enough attention to try and create a `.gitignore` to prevent those files from getting staged in the first place). (Also, as of late, most text editing and Git work has been done via Visual Studio Code for convenience reasons, which means I don't really get to do all that command line exercise that comes with doing Git operations.)

I was kind of not expecting to see more advanced concepts besides fundamental Git knowledge getting used during the Git exercise this week. One of the more important commands that I should've learned earlier on but really just learned in the Git exercises this week was `git status`, which is a good way of seeing which files haven't been committed yet (or files where there might be edits that haven't been committed yet).
