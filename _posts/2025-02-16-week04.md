title: Week 4
---

This week was a bit of everything. A bit of a Git command line lesson (but more of a refresher for me), and a lot of classmates showing off how good their JavaScript (and CSS surprisingly) skills are. It's kinda weird to see how good my classmates' presentation skills are (and they were probably better than mine)!

It was kind of interesting to just see how Git would be taught in the classroom, as I never really had a formal introduction to Git back in high school (when I was first introduced to Git and GitHub as a way of submitting assignments for my AP Computer Science class). I was mainly taught on how to clone a remote repo into my local machine, how to add files to the staging phase, how to write a commit message (like *any* Git message, and not a specially formatted one), and how to push things. Over time I kind of learned how to go out into new branches and how to jump between them, although these steps were kinda shaky since I didn't really have to use branches a lot, and how to untrack and remove files from a Git repository (since there are times when cache files accidentally get staged because I didn't pay enough attention to try and create a `.gitignore` to prevent those files from getting staged in the first place). (Also, as of late, most text editing and Git work has been done via Visual Studio Code for convenience reasons, which means I don't really get to do all that command line exercise that comes with doing Git operations.)

I was kind of not expecting to see more advanced concepts besides fundamental Git knowledge getting used during the Git exercise this week (though it was nice to get a bit of a refresher on git branching and even merging for that (since sometimes I'll be super lazy and just merge on)). One of the more important commands that I should've learned earlier on but really just learned in the Git exercises this week was `git status`, which is a good way of seeing which files haven't been committed yet (or files where there might be edits that haven't been committed yet). `git diff` is also pretty useful if you needed to quickly go check and see what changes were made between two commits (though it gets funky (like additions you've made become removals) if you do not order the two commit IDs correctly, as you should probably have the older commit ID first and then the newer commit ID). 

`git cat-file` was another Git command that was pretty interesting. It kind of has a dual purpose of acting like an enhanced `git log` that also discusses about the file structure of a git commit, shows a file structure of a repo at a certain commit (like an `ls` for a commit), and `cat` to show what the file looked like at a specific commit. I feel like this is a bit tedious, as you will need to dig through multiple different trees just to see the changes you've made at some point (though I do feel like it might ultimately be less tedious than trying to switch between different Git commits if you kind of want to refer to the content of a file that was in a previous commit that is no longer there). 

Also, I kind of didn't know that there was a non crazy way of restoring files if you accidentally deleted (or screwed up a file too much) a file but needed it back in the form of `git restore` with the name of a file. I was previously aware that I could do something similar in the GUI of most popular IDEs like VSCode, but it's pretty nice to see that I can do the same straight from the command line if I find that convienient.

One cool thing that I didn't know until now was the fact that you can `git checkout` to a commit--I was always told that you only do that in the context of checking out to a different branch.
